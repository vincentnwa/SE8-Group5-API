# SE8-Group5-API

Version 5.0.0
- Renamed app.api.key to APP_API_KEY because circleCi do not allow ".", only "_" for env variable name
- Renamed UserAccessControllerTest.java to a .txt file

## Keeping Datamall API secret

### Step 1:

In application.properties, put this in:
  `spring.profiles.active=dev`

Comment out the previous line by Jimmy :

`#APP_API_KEY=${MY_API_KEY}`

### Step 2:

Create a an application-dev.properties file in the same folder as the application.properties.

In the file, put this line:

`APP_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>`

### No action required

There are `main - resources - META-INF` and `.vscode` folder. Leave it as it is. No need to change anything.

### Git ignore

Put this line in the `.gitignore`, so that the API key will not be uploaded to github.

`/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties`

Do a `git status`. You should **not** see any git tracking of the `application-dev.properties`.


## Endpoints

Endpoints in **controllerNote.md**.

Note that there are two types of API calls here.

- One is our calls to Datamall.
- Another is our own endpoints for the front-end app.


## Load data

The Postgres database can persist now. To load the data just one time use the following GET /datamall endpoints.

To load the data, use the Datamall endpoints. Call these endpoints one by one.

The **bus routes** data is very large. Be patient and wait. It can take more than 15 minutes depending on network traffic.

```
- Bus services
  - /datamall/services
- Bus stops
  - /datamall/stops
- Bus routes
  - /datamall/routes

```

All Controller files to be in this folder

# Endpoints

### Supply to front-end

Supply to front-end, the route is prefixed by **/app**. This will return the first id of each table. This serves as a test to make sure the endpoint is working. Returning the whole data is too large.

- Bus services
  - /app/services
- To find one bus service
  - /app/services/{serviceNo}
  - localhost:8080/app/services/58
- Bus stops
  - /app/stops
- To find one bus stop
  - /app/stops/{busStopCode}
  - localhost:8080/app/stops/53009
- Bus routes
  - /app/routes
- To find bus route by service number and direction
  - /app/routes/service/{serviceNo}/direction/{direction}
  - localhost:8080/app/routes/service/80/direction/1
- Bus arrival - Notes that this will return the Datamall string as it is.
  - /app/arrival


## From datamall

This is for initial testing to get the data one by one. 

Getting from Datamall, the route is prefixed by **/datamall**.

Not using DataLoader because the data is too large.

- Bus services
  - /datamall/services
- Bus stops
  - /datamall/stops
- Bus routes
  - /datamall/routes

- skip to branching part


### Step-by-step walkthrough

1. Fork your own copy of the group Repo
2. Clone the forked repository `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`

Change to the repository directory, `cd repo`


3. Create a new branch:
`git checkout -b feature-branch` (this is a shortcut. the branch name is feature-branch here)

  Check you are on the new Branch using `git branch`.

  **General rule of thumb:** Always use `git status` or `git branch` to check you're on the new branch

4. Do your staging and commit
  - `git add -A` (to stage all new files, deleted files, and modified files. Better than git add . as that does not stage deleted files)
  - `git commit -m "your message"`


5. Publish local branch to remote and set up tracking relationship (have to do this the first time you git push on new branch):
eg. `git push --set-upstream origin features/add_MapMain` 
(above is a chained git command of `git push` and `git --set-upstream`, meaning git push is also done in this line of code)

  - Subsequently, any further git push you want to make, simply use `git push`
    - Optional:  `git push origin your-branch-name` also works.  (see below for explanation of difference)


What is upstream branch?
An upstream branch is a remote branch that your local branch tracks. upstream command pushes a local branch to the origin remote repo (eg. your forked repo), linking them, and sets local branch to track remote branch (eg. your forked repo).


6. Create a pull request on GitHub
  - Go to your forked repository on GitHub 
  - Click on "Compare & pull request"
  - Select "main" as the base branch and "feature-branch" as the compare branch
  - Click on "Create pull request"
  - Team reviews, comments, and approves
  - Once approved, you merge the pull request 


### What is difference between" git push and  git push origin your-branch-name"?

`git push` :
- If a tracking relationship has already been set up (as it is with `--set-upstream`), git push automatically pushes the current branch (eg. Joshua-Branch, the name of my branch) to its corresponding remote branch (origin/Joshua-Branch).
- This is convenient and commonly used after setting the upstream branch.

`git push origin Joshua-Branch` :
- Explicitly specifies both the remote (`origin`) and the branch (`Joshua-Branch`) to push.
- This is useful when:
- You want to push to a different branch or remote.
- No tracking relationship has been set up.
